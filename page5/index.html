      <h2 class="section-title">Carbon Emissions</h2>
      <p>Although the transition of carbon emission may be costly for companies, however there are strategies, guidance and support in the market available for companies to save on cost during the period of change, governments globally have also gave companies ample amount of time before the strict laws begin in 2030 making it manageable for companies to adapt and cope with the law.</p>
      <p>Moving towards a zero methane future, will greatly help with the climate crisis issue, it is not too late to make a change and be part of saving the ocean marine life, giving statical hope for a greener future and minimizing marine life extinction as possible, keeping a more balanced ecosystem rather than the future which is statically proven to happen if no actions are taken now.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Environmental Pollution</h2>
      <p>Although not many are aware, environmental pollution is very common. Some common examples are throwing gums on the ground or littering. To few, it may seem like a small litter and does not affect much however wildlife may take them as food which may be hazards for them. Most commonly heard of environmental pollution will be at beaches as tourists or people going for picnic leave stuff without cleaning up after their activities. Some of these waste are left behind and kill aquatic wildlife and can increase the risk of gems infecting livestocks that we humans eat.</p>
      <p>In summary, reducing environmental pollution can benefit not us human well-beings, but the planet as well. It can provide better air quality, preventing respiratory diseases or cardiovascular conditions and can also prevent bacterias from mutating and evolving which can cause planetary pandemics.</p>
